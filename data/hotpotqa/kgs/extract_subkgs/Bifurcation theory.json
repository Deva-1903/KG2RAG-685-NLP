Most commonly applied to the mathematical study of dynamical systems, a bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change made to the parameter values (the bifurcation parameters) of a system causes a sudden 'qualitative' or topological change in its behaviour.\n\nTriplets:\n<bifurcation theory","study of","changes"]],"1":[["Bifurcation theory","systems type","discrete"],["Bifurcation theory","systems type","continuous"]],"2":[["bifurcation","year introduced","1885"],["--------------------\nText: Bifurcation theory:  The name \"bifurcation\" was first introduced by Henri Poincar\u00e9 in 1885 in the first paper in mathematics showing such a behavior.\nTriplets:<Henri Poincar\u00e9","introduced","bifurcation"]],"3":[["Text: Bifurcation theory:  Henri Poincar\u00e9 also later named various types of stationary points and classified them.\nTriplets:<Henri Poincar\u00e9","named various types","stationary points"]]}
