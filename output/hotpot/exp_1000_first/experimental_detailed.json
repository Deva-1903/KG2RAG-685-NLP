On the other hand, Frederick King Keller has a background in film and television, having worked with his father who was a pioneer in television production and direction. He also acted and directed in theater and ran art house movie theaters, which gave him a solid foundation in filmmaking.\n\nConsidering this information, I would say that Frederick King Keller had more diverse job experiences than Ian Schneider.",
